# Template Documentaion

This template works by using a set of CHANGEME tags across the whole repository
and using a python script it changes all of those tags to match your repository,
making it seem just as if you built everything from the ground up specifically
for your project. For a full list of features this template has read
[Features](template/FEATURES.md).

**For this template to work with no changes make sure to choose a repository
name that is not present on crates.io or in the AUR**

**Required to follow**: [How to Start](template/START.md) &
[Requirements](template/REQ.md)

**For proper use give a read**: [Features](template/FEATURES.md) &
[Workflow](template/WORKFLOW.md)
