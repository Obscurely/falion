Computer security, cybersecurity (cyber security), digital security or
information technology security (IT security) is the protection of computer
systems and networks from attack by malicious actors that may result in
unauthorized information disclosure, theft of, or damage to hardware, software,
or data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they
provide. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security))

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of
[Obscurely's](https://github.com/Obscurely) repository that meets the definition
below please report it to us as described below.

Vulnerabilities are flaws in a computer system that weaken the overall security
of the device/system. Vulnerabilities can be weaknesses in either the hardware
itself, or the software that runs on the hardware. Vulnerabilities can be
exploited by a threat actor, such as an attacker, to cross privilege boundaries
(i.e. perform unauthorized actions) within a computer system. To exploit a
vulnerability, an attacker must have at least one applicable tool or technique
that can connect to a system weakness. In this frame, vulnerabilities are also
known as the attack surface. (Source:

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report it by sending an email to
[obscurely.message@protonmail.com](mailto:obscurely.message@protonmail.com)

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not,
please resend that email to ensure I received your original message. I may not
be available, if so please wait and **do not make the vulnerability public**

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can
provide) to help me better understand the nature and scope of the possible
issue:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting,
  etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help me triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

I prefer all communications to be in English, but we have translation software
nowdays so you do you.

## Policy

In computer security, coordinated vulnerability disclosure, or "CVD" (formerly
known as responsible disclosure) is a vulnerability disclosure model in which a
vulnerability or an issue is disclosed to the public only after the responsible
parties have been allowed sufficient time to patch or remedy the vulnerability
or issue. This coordination distinguishes the CVD model from the "full
disclosure" model. (Source:
